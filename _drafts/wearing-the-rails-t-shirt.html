<p>The <a title="EdgeRails wiki" href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/EdgeRails">EdgeRails</a> wiki provided a good starting point but there were some problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rails seems to define no <em>default</em> rake target so a bare "rake" command fails.  "rake fresh_rails" seemed to be the right answer.  Not quite sure if it worked though, because I saw this in the output:</li>
<ol>
<li>unrecognized option `--line-numbers --inline-source'<br />
For help on options, try 'rdoc --help'<br />
rake aborted!</li>
</ol>
<li>Nevertheless, the task seemed to complete so I'm going to assume it worked.</li>
</ol>
<p>hi</p>
