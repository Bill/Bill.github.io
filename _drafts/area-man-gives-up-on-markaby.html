<p>I love <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/inspect/markabyForRails.html">Markaby</a>.  HTML syntax just sucks and the Ruby DSL is a big improvement.  Ruby expressions and blocks take care of generating close tags for you.  No more angle brackets.</p>
<p>Things start to break down, however, when Markaby meets Rails.  I feel pretty sure that Markaby actually works -- it's just that I can't juggle a sufficiently rich mental model of the whole complex environment:</p>
<p>Markaby -- uses instance_eval in .mab templates (views) so that all methods are evaluated on a Markaby builder object -- putting  Markaby in control and simplifying syntax.  It even has magic (<a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/inspect/markabySMagicPermeationBranch.html">so magic it <em>hurts</em></a>)</p>
<p>ActionView<br />
ActionView::Helpers<br />
Named Routes</p>
<p>Others are having similar difficulties:</p>

<p>When I started using Rails 1.2 (RC) I started seeing exceptions from Markaby views to this effect "you're trying to access a protected member of the view" when calling named routes (e.g. <code>person_url</code>).  That was the final straw. Rather than trying to figure out whether it was my problem, Markaby's or Rails' I just decided to give in, stop pushing the rope, and say goodbye to Markaby.</p>
<p>I'll miss your terseness Markaby.  But I need all the minutes I can get to iron out my <a href="http://www.ujs4rails.com/">UJS</a> code.</p>
