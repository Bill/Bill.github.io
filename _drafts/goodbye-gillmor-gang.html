<p>Thank you, Steve Gillmor and company, for a year or so of fascinating conversation. The episodes you aired between the middle of '05 and Spring of '06 were so good that often I'd listen to them more than once. The show exemplified the best of what podcasting can be.  You brought actual voices formerly heard only in print. You produced content laser-focused on an audience too small to ever be economically viable to "traditional media" (sorry, I know you loathe that disappearing distinction). You engaged in gonzo self promotion of your cherished user-in-charge attention movement. You engaged in open verbal combat complete with cuss words.</p>
<p>I've been mourning the loss of old show for a while.  I've cycled through the classic phases and find myself beyond a protracted anger phase and smack in the middle of grief.</p>
<p>somewhere around Phlegm at 11 Gang</p>
<p>what changed<br />
you've lost your cause -- attention no longer rings true, you seem to have given up on it or at least have nothing new to say.  I don't blame you for the air going out of that cause.  But I wish you'd take up a new one.<br />
you've swung too far from "journalistic detachment" to "platform for newsmaker".  There's a delicate balance required when we portray newsmakers as analysists.  That very balance is often what makes blogging so interesting and dangerous.  In the past six months or so, the balance has swung too far toward the voices of the newsmakers: Calcanis, Arrington and non-analysits: Macleod.</p>
<p>you've lost your depth -- with the loss of Jon Udell and the new prevalence of Hugh Macleod, Jason Calcanis, Mike Arrington</p>
