Well the memerocket.com domain is a casualty of the [RegisterFly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registerfly) [debacle](http://registerflies.com/) so you're reading this at the replacement domain meme-rocket.com.  You know ... the many frustrating hours wasted trying to recover ownership, and the money spent on replacement domains and domain recovery, and the time spent telling WordPress and Apache about the new name, and proving ownership to Technorati and Google, and losing my OpenID, and having my hard-won Technorati position of 84,121 slip to 2,856,595, and having to notify all my friends of the new domain wouldn't be so bad if ... come to think of it -- it _is _so bad.  Feh.
