I was going to tell you about Jonathan Ive's [recent pithy pronouncement](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/technology/2009/07/listening_to_mr_iphone.html) on focus groups to wit:


<blockquote>"We don't do focus groups," he said firmly, explaining that they resulted in bland products designed not to offend anyone.</blockquote>


But I won't do that because when I went to Wikipedia to research "focus group" for the post, I noticed that their page had already been updated with the Ive quote. [It had been updated](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Focus_group&oldid=299684522) on the same day as the original BBC dot.life article. Wikipedia surprises me again with its velocity.
