<p>I love my Macs. But dang it, I've encountered a couple annoying Leopard problems that have significantly impacted their value.</p>
<p>First, my old iMac <a title="Problem Description on Apple Support" href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=6213751?">won't connect</a> via WPA2 to my Airport Extreme since upgrading to Leopard. What am I gonna do—run an ethernet cable across my living room floor. Or should I say: across my wife's living room floor?!?</p>
<p>Second, this week, my MacBook Pro <a title="Problem Description on MacFixit" href="http://www.macfixit.com/article.php?story=20080227122124501">stopped waking</a> from sleep mode. The solution is simple but devastating - simply turn off Bluetooth…um, and then you don't have Bluetooth.</p>
<p>What is going on here? I've had years of happiness with my OS X Macs. And now I've got two men down (out of three). Only the trusty PowerBook is unaffected by any of this.</p>
<p>'sup Apple? Did you get ahead of yourselves with the sheer pace of coolness?</p>
<p><strong>update </strong>June 6, 2008: The good guys at <a href="http://www.macforce.com/">MacForce</a> helped me out w/ the sleep/wake problem on the MBP. The fix was simple: <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1431?viewlocale=en_US">reset the PMU</a>. A no-brainer (but only if you think of it). WPA still broken on the iMac as of OS X 10.5.3.</p>
