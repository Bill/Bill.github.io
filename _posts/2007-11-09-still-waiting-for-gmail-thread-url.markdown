Update to [Gmail Thread URL](/2007/07/26/gmail-thread-url/). [Folks](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/10/gmails-new-version-is-now-available.html) [are](http://tech.markjaquith.com/2007/11/02/gmail-20-features-permalinks/) [claiming](http://www.7hirst.com/content/2007/11/03/gmail-20-permalinks-useful-flawed) that the recently released (to some folks) Gmail "2.0" supports permalinks to threads (and various other resources e.g. inbox).

I have the new version running on Firefox and I see no explicit permalink support for threads. I fiddled around a little with some thread URLs e.g.:
`https://mail.google.com/mail/#inbox/1161876aa6a75d27`
I copied that from Firefox and pasted it into Safari's location bar and was taken not to the thread but to my inbox. Still waiting for Gmail to support permalinks.
