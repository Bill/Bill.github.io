As I mentioned, [Gordita](http://www.memerocket.com/2006/11/05/gordita-delicious-tagging-for-google-reader/) has a problem on Firefox 2.0.  Here's a workaround for Mac folks so you don't have to leave the keyboard.

What you'd like is a key combo that'll switch from the current Firefox window to the one that just opened behind it.  Unlike the PC where all windows are created equal and alt-tab will cycle between them, on the Mac command-tab cycles between _applications_.  If an application has multiple windows open, only the focus window can be switched to with command-tab.

Turns out you can use **command-`** -- that's **command-backquote** on OS X to cycle between windows of the current application. When your Gordita pops up the del.icio.us window behind the focus window, hit command-` and assuming you had no other Firefox windows open, it'll cycle your little del.icio.us window to the top.

I hope this is sufficient to dissuade [Blake Burris](http://blake.typepad.com/blog/2006/11/bill_burcham_go.html) and others from fiddling w/ [Minefield](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/minefield/).  I tried that thing and I do not recommend going there.  Most extensions don't work and it has [other](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=355138) odd bugs.
