<p>What started a few days ago as a little tinkering with a <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/09/our-plans-for-code-jam.html">Google Code Jam</a> practice problem (Big City Skyline) turned into a mini-benchmark of three Ruby VM's on my MacBook Pro 2.2GHz. The program (a solution to the "Big City Skyline" problem) is an O( N log( N ) ) in-memory search with a little integer math.</p>
<p>Quickie findings: the in-development Ruby 1.9 VM performed best -- beating 1.8.6 by a factor of two. For the numbers (comparing 1.8.6, 1.9 pre-release, and Rubinius pre-release) have a look at the <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p1qlnCJRXgyIG-9uhSAnHBw">spreadsheet and chart</a> over on Google Docs. Also of note: the Ruby solution did beat the four minute time limit for N=10MM given in the <a href="http://services.google.com/blog_resources/Google_CodeJam_Practice.pdf">problem statement</a>. This was on random input. Worst-case performance would not be as good.</p>
<p>It makes me happy that the <a href="http://pastie.caboo.se/98009">Ruby solution</a> had adequate performance. Also it was interesting to see how the Ruby language fit for a problem you'd usually see done in LISP. I would have liked to have dynamic scope to do a cleaner implementation of @@largest_so_far. On the other hand, "memoization" is pretty natural in an OO language like Ruby -- you create an instance (of Skyline) for each context and simply use instance variables to hold previous results.</p>
<p><strong>update</strong> Nov 15, 2007: Reader Sumudu points out that <a href="http://pastie.caboo.se/98009">version 5</a> neglects to reset the timer between pruning and non-pruning variations. <a href="http://pastie.caboo.se/118616">Version 6</a> rectifies this error. With that change it's apparent that the pruning has no positive effect. In fact non-pruning actually wins by a small amount for N=1 to N=100,000 on my MacBook Pro.</p>
