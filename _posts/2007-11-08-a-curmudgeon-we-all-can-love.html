<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-188" title="rhinobookthumbnail" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/rhinobookthumbnail.gif" alt="rhinobookthumbnail" width="73" height="96" />Douglas Crockford, purveyor of the <a href="http://json.org/JSONRequest.html">JSONRequest spec</a>, is cranky in a polite sort of way. He also happens to be right!  Check out the video of his recent talk on <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/11/06/video-crockford/">The State of AJAX</a>.</p>
<p>Crockford takes us through a brief history of computing reminding us, as we've been reminded before, that the Web interaction model is practically the same as the mainframe 3270 interaction model circa 1972.</p>
<p>The most potent moment in the talk however, is when he shows a shot of a mermaid rendered via a run of the mill nvidia subsystem and dryly points out "look, rounded corners". The upshot: the 1984 Macintosh had rounded corners â€” browsers were obsolete from the git go and there is a huge and widening gap between what you do in a web app and what you do in a non-web one.</p>
<p>Oh and I'm making <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">Crockford</a> my <em>Personal Hero of the Month</em> for pointing out that not only are our web technologies based on eight-year-old standards (HTML 4.0.1, ECMAscript ed. 3, CSS 3) started in '98 and still under development but that of those, CSS is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#Limitations">worst</a> of the lot and should be replaced with urgent haste. Refreshing respite from the usual <a href="http://www.transcendingcss.com/">CSS love</a>.</p>
<p>"Don't take any crap."</p>
<p><strong>update</strong>: watch this space for my growing list of <em>web standards revolutionaries</em>:</p>
