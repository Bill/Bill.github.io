<p>Google Chrome runs on your Mac now. Google Chrome supports Extensions now. Unfortunately, Google Chrome on your Mac doesn't support extensions now.</p>
<p>Well that's not exactly true. It's hard to find, but you can get the developer build of Chrome for the Mac. It's prebuilt on the <a href="http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-mac/">Chromium Buildbot Snapshots for Mac Page</a>. Scroll to the bottom and download the latest Zip archive. It contains the app (Chromium) which you just drag to your Applications folder.<a href="http://memerocket.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/screen-shot-2009-12-17-at-7-47-36-am1.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-290" title="Screen shot 2009-12-17 at 7.47.36 AM" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screen-shot-2009-12-17-at-7-47-36-am1.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="60" /></a></p>
<p>After it's in place, use it to browse to the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/">Official Google Chrome Extensions</a> site. Then check out theÂ <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/okanipcmceoeemlbjnmnbdibhgpbllgc">Google Quick Scroll Extension</a>, which continues your Google search beyond the results page, right on the third-party pages you jump to.</p>
