<p>I like to have a TED or SALT talk playing while I work on something mindless. The problem is that on my single 15" display, there isn't really enough room to keep my work and the video (window) side-by-side. I'd like to designate the video window as the top window so that it never gets buried.</p>

<p>I found two OS X solutions, each of which appear to be OS X window manager hacks to let you force a window to float atop all the others: <a href="http://infinite-labs.net/afloat/">∞labs Afloat</a> and <a href="http://unsanity.com/haxies/wsx">Unsanity WindowShade X</a>. I installed the latter and can attest that (after a reboot) it will indeed keep a browser window afloat. Just select the window of interest and hit the command key twice (⌘-⌘). The keystroke is configurable.</p>
<p>WindowShade X relies on <a href="http://unsanity.com/haxies/ape">Unsanity's Application Enhancer</a>. I was concerned about security vulnerabilities introduced by that thing but since my Google searching didn't turn up any obvious warnings I went ahead with it.</p>
