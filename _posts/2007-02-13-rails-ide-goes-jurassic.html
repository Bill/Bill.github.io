<p>About a year ago in <a href="http://www.memerocket.com/2006/02/01/smalltalk-browser-goes-jurassic/">Smalltalk Browser Goes Jurassic</a> I lamented the fact that the Smalltalk browser UI was caught in a techno-aesthetic time warp and cheered the possibility that it might escape to the future and in doing so completely skip a whole generation of UI effort-waste and bad taste (e.g. Eclipse <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Rich_Client_Platform">Rich Client Platform</a>) and move directly to Web-technology UI currency.  I ended with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>How long will it be before a complete IDE is delivered as a web application? To varying degrees, Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA are stuck on the same island that Smalltalk was. Theyâ€™re all trying to be graphically rich and run on many platforms. Theyâ€™re all expending lots of resources maintaining UI toolkits (think of Eclipseâ€™s Rich Client Platform). And the resultant UI technology, while often innovative and sometimes pleasing, suffers a â€œcredibility gapâ€ when compared with platform-specific technology on the Mac or Windows. When will the IDEâ€™s throw their weight behind the DHTML+AJAX crowd and embrace the â€œthird platformâ€?</p></blockquote>
<p>Well there is renewed hope - but it looks like Ruby and Rails may arrive before Squeak does.  <a href="http://gyre.bitscribe.net/">Gyre</a> is an honest-to-goodness Ruby on Rails IDE delivered through the browser complete with source-level interactive debugging, project navigation, and an interesting syntax-aware text editor.</p>
<p>Seems like the next step is to get the <a href="http://gyre.bitscribe.net/">Gyre</a> folks working with the <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> folks.  Can you imagine it?</p>
