<p>I was going to tell you about Jonathan Ive's <a title="BBC dot.life interview with Jonathan Ive" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/technology/2009/07/listening_to_mr_iphone.html">recent pithy pronouncement</a> on focus groups to wit:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We don't do focus groups," he said firmly, explaining that they resulted in bland products designed not to offend anyone.</p></blockquote>
<p>But I won't do that because when I went to Wikipedia to research "focus group" for the post, I noticed that their page had already been updated with the Ive quote. <a title="Wikipedia &quot;focus group&quot; edit" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Focus_group&amp;oldid=299684522">It had been updated</a> on the same day as the original BBC dot.life article. Wikipedia surprises me again with its velocity.</p>
