<p>Update to <a href="/2007/07/26/gmail-thread-url/">Gmail Thread URL</a>. <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/10/gmails-new-version-is-now-available.html">Folks</a> <a href="http://tech.markjaquith.com/2007/11/02/gmail-20-features-permalinks/">are</a> <a href="http://www.7hirst.com/content/2007/11/03/gmail-20-permalinks-useful-flawed">claiming</a> that the recently released (to some folks) Gmail "2.0" supports permalinks to threads (and various other resources e.g. inbox).</p>
<p>I have the new version running on Firefox and I see no explicit permalink support for threads. I fiddled around a little with some thread URLs e.g.:<br />
<code>https://mail.google.com/mail/#inbox/1161876aa6a75d27</code><br />
I copied that from Firefox and pasted it into Safari's location bar and was taken not to the thread but to my inbox. Still waiting for Gmail to support permalinks.</p>
