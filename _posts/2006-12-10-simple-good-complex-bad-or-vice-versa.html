<p>In a recent <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/12/09.html">article</a>, Joel on software claims that simplicity is overrated, that users want more features, and the single thing his company does to drive more sales is to release a new version of an existing product with more features.  What's notable is that a week earlier, he wrote this well-circulated <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/11/24.html">post</a> lambasting Microsoft for having too much choice in the shutdown menu in Vista, and advocated for a simple, one-button shutdown solution.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I wonder if his users really want new features, or just a new release.  It would be interesting to compare if the adoption of new releases is in any way related to the feature set of that new release -- in the one extreme case, if you sold a new version of your software with just a new version number, would that alone drive sales up. (If only once...)</p>
<p>The other extreme case is also interesting -- what if you silently added features to your product, but never explicitly made a new release.  Web software-as-service is like this -- what version of gmail do you use?  None of the google services even display a version number (other than "beta") anywhere, at least that I can find.  They seem to do OK.</p>
