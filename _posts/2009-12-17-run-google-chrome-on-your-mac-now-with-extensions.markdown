Google Chrome runs on your Mac now. Google Chrome supports Extensions now. Unfortunately, Google Chrome on your Mac doesn't support extensions now.

Well that's not exactly true. It's hard to find, but you can get the developer build of Chrome for the Mac. It's prebuilt on the [Chromium Buildbot Snapshots for Mac Page](http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-mac/). Scroll to the bottom and download the latest Zip archive. It contains the app (Chromium) which you just drag to your Applications folder.[![](http://memerocket.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/screen-shot-2009-12-17-at-7-47-36-am1.png?w=300)](http://memerocket.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/screen-shot-2009-12-17-at-7-47-36-am1.png)

After it's in place, use it to browse to the [Official Google Chrome Extensions](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/) site. Then check out theÂ [Google Quick Scroll Extension](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/okanipcmceoeemlbjnmnbdibhgpbllgc), which continues your Google search beyond the results page, right on the third-party pages you jump to.
