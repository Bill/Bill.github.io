In a recent [article](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/12/09.html), Joel on software claims that simplicity is overrated, that users want more features, and the single thing his company does to drive more sales is to release a new version of an existing product with more features.  What's notable is that a week earlier, he wrote this well-circulated [post](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/11/24.html) lambasting Microsoft for having too much choice in the shutdown menu in Vista, and advocated for a simple, one-button shutdown solution.

I wonder if his users really want new features, or just a new release.  It would be interesting to compare if the adoption of new releases is in any way related to the feature set of that new release -- in the one extreme case, if you sold a new version of your software with just a new version number, would that alone drive sales up. (If only once...)

The other extreme case is also interesting -- what if you silently added features to your product, but never explicitly made a new release.  Web software-as-service is like this -- what version of gmail do you use?  None of the google services even display a version number (other than "beta") anywhere, at least that I can find.  They seem to do OK.
