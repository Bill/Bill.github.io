I'm tired of creating HTML attribution markup and style by hand every time I drop a Flickr photo into a post. I noticed the [Yahoo Shortcut Plugin](http://www.searchenginejournal.com/yahoo-shortcuts-wordpress-plugin/6102/) purports to address this issue. So I ended my procrastination and upgraded to WordPress 2.3.2 and installed the plugin. And here we are (see the image to the left)




Convincing the Yahoo Shortcuts Plugin to fetch the actual image of interest wasn't as easy as I'd like but it's clearly doable. I found the image using [colrpickr](http://www.krazydad.com/colrpickr/), then navigated to the image and then entered the title of the image in the Yahoo Shortcut Plugin's "Review This Post" view. The plugin found the image and allowed me to then add the image to my post.




Now wouldn't it be the bomb if [krazydad](http://www.krazydad.com) could integrate his colrpickr directly with the Yahoo thingie and save us all the steps?
