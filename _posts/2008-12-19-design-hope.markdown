Veerle](http://veerle.duoh.com) is one of my favorite Web designers. She [came clean recently](http://veerle.duoh.com/blog/comments/my_first_duoh_website/) and republished her first website circa 1996! She cited Jason Santamaria's recent post about [his own earliest Web work](http://jasonsantamaria.com/articles/my-first-website/). OK so now I have another new favorite Web designer.

What's so cool is how unappetizing, especially Veerle's, early sites are. To be fair, hers was perpetrated four years before Jason's. And those were four big years too. But my intention is not to criticize.

What strikes me about this exercise is that it shows once again that there is no such thing as overnight success. You see in the decade-or-so of work a progression from ugh/ho-hum to pow! Take heart. Keep working.
