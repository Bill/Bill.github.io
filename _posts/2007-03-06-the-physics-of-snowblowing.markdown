Harry the homeowner needs to remove the snow from his driveway.  He has a snowblower that accomplishes this task well for normal snowfall. However, it can't clear the high drifts of plow-wash when the city snowplows clear off the street in front of his house. This snow is piled too high, and compressed too much for the snowblower to work.  So, Harry wants to clear the street in front of his driveway before the plow comes so that there is no snow for it to push into his driveway.  Where, exactly, in the street should Harry clear?  What variables determine the size and shape of the cleared area?
