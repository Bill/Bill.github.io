<p>You may have noticed that the <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/press/mozilla-2006-10-24.html">latest</a> release of Firefox (2.0) supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript">JavaScript</a> 1.7.Â  I was curious about just what the new JavaScript features were so I did a little poking around.Â  It turns out that if you peel back a little of the arbitrarily divergent terminology you find some features that map perfectly onto Ruby.Â  JavaScript (1.6) and Ruby already had a lot in common.Â  But with JavaScript 1.7 its hard not to suspect a conscious, coordinated convergence conspiracy.</p>
<p>JavaScript <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/New_in_JavaScript_1.7#Generators_and_iterators">generators and iterators</a> are now supported through the familiar (to Rubyists) <strong>yield</strong> keyword.Â  A generator is a function that yields values -- like a coroutine.Â  It isn't obvious how to implement the Ruby cornerstone: yield to a block passed to a method, but being able to do coroutines is a welcome advance.</p>
<p>Then there's this thing that JavaScript 1.7 calls <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/New_in_JavaScript_1.7#Destructuring_assignment">destructuring assignment</a> which essentially lets you have <span style="font-weight:bold;">multiple return</span> values from a function -- just like Ruby.<br />
On the browser front, it looks like IE7 is going to support JavaScript 1.6 and not 1.7 initially, so from a client-side perspective this is kind of academic for the moment. Â  However the convergence is hopeful from the perspective of can't-we-all-just-get-along VM sharing a la <a href="http://www.parrotcode.org/">parrot</a>.</p>
