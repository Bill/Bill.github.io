<p>Github gave me a whole new reason to love them last week when they introduced <a title="An Introduction to Agency-Aware Identity" href="http://lesscode.org/2006/04/15/many-lives-just-one-you/">agency-aware identity</a> in their new <a title="Github Organizations Announcement" href="http://github.com/blog/674-introducing-organizations">organizations</a> offering. Crazy cool. Now each of my clients can have their own Github organization and I can participate in each! Same goes for each of my Open Source projects. And I can use it for a day job if I had such a thing. And all with one identityâ€”one set of credentials. Brilliant Github!</p>
