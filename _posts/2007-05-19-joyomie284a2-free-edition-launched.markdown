![joyomi-logo](/assets/{{page.path | remove_first: '_posts/' | remove: '.markdown'}}/joyomi-logo.jpg)As of this morning, [Joyomi](http://joyomi.com) is available for everyone who'd like a free account.

You've heard of a "to do" list, well [Joyomi](http://joyomi.com) manages your "**_to get_**" list. [Joyomi](http://joyomi.com) highlights overdue stuff and helps you get it back. If you've lent a book to a friend, create a Book Omi and you'll remember to ask for the book back next month.

Same idea for CDs and DVDs and money too. There's a whole set of starter Omis. If you don't find one that fits your purpose you can create a generic one.

[Joyomi](http://joyomi.com/) doesn't just track your _stuff_ it tracks your online _**conversations**_ too. Use the [Joyomi](http://joyomi.com/) Bookmarklet to create Omi's for important emails, blog comments and forum posts as well. With [Joyomi](http://joyomi.com/) you don't have to remember to visit a bunch of sitesâ€”all the conversations are consolidated in one clean dashboard.

Once you've created an Omi it's easy to _**share**_ it with a friend. Nothing like those gentle reminders!
