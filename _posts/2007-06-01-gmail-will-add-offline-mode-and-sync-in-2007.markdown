When I made this [jyte claim](http://jyte.com/cl/gmail-will-add-offline-mode-and-sync-in-2007) [![](http://jyte.com/images/logo.gif?1180659691)](http://jyte.com) a couple weeks ago (May 15, 2007) I believed it based solely on my personal experience of using web apps every day:  


<blockquote>A backlash is brewing against traditional thin-client web applications. Folks are tired of the beachball. Vendors of Web-based applications like Gmail, in which users spend a significant portion of their day, will respond by incorporating client-side persistence, offline operation and synchronization. In particular Gmail will add these features in 2007.</blockquote>

Well then a couple days ago (May 30, 2007), Google announced [Google Gears ](http://gears.google.com) ![](http://gears.google.com/images/workerpool.gif), their toolkit for offline web apps (connection detection, offline operation, offline storage) and updated Reader with an offline mode. This thing is similar in purpose to [Joyent's Slingshot](http://joyeur.com/2007/03/22/joyent-slingshot) which went into Beta on the Mac on April 17, 2007.  
  
It sure seems like the stage is set. Technology answers need. Only thing standing in the way might be competing priorities or strategic conflicts. Have to think about that a little bit.
