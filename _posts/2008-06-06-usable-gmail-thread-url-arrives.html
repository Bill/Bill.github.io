<p>I was optimistic that the Quick Links feature just released with the new Gmail Labs would <a href="2007/11/09/still-waiting-for-gmail-thread-url/">scratch my itch</a> for the ability to link to Gmail threads. Well Quick Links itself is pretty raw but I was able to use it to figure out the URL format for a thread to wit:https://mail.google.com/mail/?zx=mca2fxr2r24c#inbox/11a5bb2474f4842dI hadn't seen that 'zx' query parameter before and it appears to be not strictly necessary (may be a <a href="http://johnvey.com/features/gmailapi/">proxy cache defeater</a>—I removed it and found the URL still worked fine).What is new to me is that whereas last time I tried to revisit such an URL I was taken not to the thread, but to my Inbox, now when I replay this URL I am taken to the thread (as expected!)Now if Gmail <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gmail-labs-help-quick-links/browse_thread/thread/78869e6e91c3c12c#">would only provide</a> a “Link to this page” control à la Google Maps my life would be complete.</p>
