The New York Times' multimedia presentation viewer is a thing of beauty. The example below is taken from a [story on Benazir Bhutto](http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/world/20071227_BHUTTO_FEATURE/index.html#section1).

Flash wins again. Notice how hovering over the thumb yields a time-indexed image popup. Very fluid, very useful.
