<p>I use <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> and just love it.  I particularly like the syntax highlighting and formatting and the ability to pick themes.  My current favorite is Twilight.</p>
<p>The way TextMate understands various languages (e.g. HTML, CSS, Ruby) is via "bundles".  Bundles also define extra "commands" to the editor e.g. there's a command to run the W3C syntax validator on the current document. There are a bunch of bundles that ship with TextMate, and there are also a bunch being developed by the community.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, over on #refreshdallas IRC yesterday evening I was asking if anyone knew of a way to induce TextMate to output a styled HTML file for whatever file you were currently editing.  The idea was that if I was editing Ruby, or CSS, or HTML or whatever, and I'd chosen a particular theme, and I liked the way that looked -- I'd like to be able to press a button and generate an HTML document that I could drop into my blog or into an S5 presentation.  The way I've been doing this lately is to capture a TIFF of the TextMate window via Grab but that's just tedious (have to convert to GIF and then there are all the sizing limitations associated with images.)</p>
<p>While I was on the #refreshdallas IRC I was also on the ##textmate IRC asking similar questions and some <a href="http://subtlegradient.com">really</a> <a href="http://macromates.com/blog/">helpful</a> people told me about the "<a href="http://macromates.com/svn/Bundles/trunk/Bundles/Experimental.tmbundle/">Experimental</a>" bundle.  It had a command very close to what I needed called "View Document as HTML".  That one did not use the current theme to generate the CSS (it had a hard-coded CSS embedded) and it didn't show the HTML -- it rendered to a WebKit HTML window directly.  They suggested I use that command as a starting point, so I played around w/ it a bit and made a little progress.</p>
<p>And then I watched <a href="http://www.scifi.com/firefly/episodes/season1/0102/">a movie</a> and went to sleep...</p>
<p>And when I woke up this am, ready to go do this thing, I decided to start clean and do a fresh "svn co" on the Experimental bundle before getting down to the business of writing a TextMate-theme-to-CSS transformation (XSLT) and wrapping that in a TextMate command and mashing it up with the "View Document as HTML" genetic material.  When lo I noticed in the Experimental/Commands a new entry: "Create HTML from Document / Selection".</p>
<p>So I ran it.</p>
<p>Up popped a new editor window containing an HTML document with loads of delicious CSS and the target document rendered in the body all formatted nice w/ spans w/ class attrs.</p>
<p>I hit command-B to render that file in the browser and pow!  Up popped a Firefox window that looked very much like the original TextMate window!  The layout was great.  The colors perfect.  The font was a little off, but hey, that can be tweaked.</p>
<p>So what elf was responsible for delivering this overnight gift?  A bit of poking around on ##textmate revealed it was a certain <a href="http://bradchoate.com">Brad Choate</a> had contributed this blessed addition.  Now I'm off to plumb the sublime depths of his implementation.</p>
