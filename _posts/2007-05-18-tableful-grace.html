<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-200" title="firefoxscreensnapz023" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/firefoxscreensnapz023.jpg?w=246" alt="firefoxscreensnapz023" width="246" height="300" /> I love reading about table-less layout with CSS. My experience though has been that it never really works for forms. I always end up resorting to tables to lay out my labels, controls and instructions. Well brother, Dan Benjamin and Dan Cederholm provide absolution.<br />
Witness the tableful layout of the <a href="http://corkd.com/signup">Cork'd signup</a> form at the right. Be at peace. Use tables to lay out your forms. Life is full of sweet pleasures.</p>
