I was optimistic that the Quick Links feature just released with the new Gmail Labs would [scratch my itch](2007/11/09/still-waiting-for-gmail-thread-url/) for the ability to link to Gmail threads. Well Quick Links itself is pretty raw but I was able to use it to figure out the URL format for a thread to wit:https://mail.google.com/mail/?zx=mca2fxr2r24c#inbox/11a5bb2474f4842dI hadn't seen that 'zx' query parameter before and it appears to be not strictly necessary (may be a [proxy cache defeater](http://johnvey.com/features/gmailapi/)—I removed it and found the URL still worked fine).What is new to me is that whereas last time I tried to revisit such an URL I was taken not to the thread, but to my Inbox, now when I replay this URL I am taken to the thread (as expected!)Now if Gmail [would only provide](http://groups.google.com/group/gmail-labs-help-quick-links/browse_thread/thread/78869e6e91c3c12c#) a “Link to this page” control à la Google Maps my life would be complete.
