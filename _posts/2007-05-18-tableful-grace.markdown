![firefoxscreensnapz023](/assets/{{page.path | remove_first: '_posts/' | remove: '.markdown'}}/firefoxscreensnapz023.jpg?w=246) I love reading about table-less layout with CSS. My experience though has been that it never really works for forms. I always end up resorting to tables to lay out my labels, controls and instructions. Well brother, Dan Benjamin and Dan Cederholm provide absolution.
Witness the tableful layout of the [Cork'd signup](http://corkd.com/signup) form at the right. Be at peace. Use tables to lay out your forms. Life is full of sweet pleasures.
