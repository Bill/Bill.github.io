Github gave me a whole new reason to love them last week when they introduced [agency-aware identity](http://lesscode.org/2006/04/15/many-lives-just-one-you/) in their new [organizations](http://github.com/blog/674-introducing-organizations) offering. Crazy cool. Now each of my clients can have their own Github organization and I can participate in each! Same goes for each of my Open Source projects. And I can use it for a day job if I had such a thing. And all with one identityâ€”one set of credentials. Brilliant Github!
