The [Thought Propulsion™](http://thoughtpropulsion.com/) corporate site is up and running. For the technically inclined, here are some interesting facts:  


  * hosted on [Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/)
  * using the extremely slick [EC2 On Rails](http://ec2onrails.rubyforge.org/) Ubuntu/Ruby on Rails [virtual appliance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_appliance)
  * there's a tasty microformatted [hcard](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard) on the [contact](http://thoughtpropulsion.com/contact) page (check it out with [Operator](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4106))
  * OpenID login (foreshadowing)

And of course a nice gray and orange theme just in time for Halloween.
