<p>As I mentioned, <a href="http://www.memerocket.com/2006/11/05/gordita-delicious-tagging-for-google-reader/">Gordita</a> has a problem on Firefox 2.0.  Here's a workaround for Mac folks so you don't have to leave the keyboard.</p>
<p>What you'd like is a key combo that'll switch from the current Firefox window to the one that just opened behind it.  Unlike the PC where all windows are created equal and alt-tab will cycle between them, on the Mac command-tab cycles between <em>applications</em>.  If an application has multiple windows open, only the focus window can be switched to with command-tab.</p>
<p>Turns out you can use <strong>command-`</strong> -- that's <strong>command-backquote</strong> on OS X to cycle between windows of the current application. When your Gordita pops up the del.icio.us window behind the focus window, hit command-` and assuming you had no other Firefox windows open, it'll cycle your little del.icio.us window to the top.</p>
<p>I hope this is sufficient to dissuade <a title="Blake Digs Gordita" href="http://blake.typepad.com/blog/2006/11/bill_burcham_go.html">Blake Burris</a> and others from fiddling w/ <a title="Minefield, the bleeding edge Firefox build" href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/minefield/">Minefield</a>.  I tried that thing and I do not recommend going there.  Most extensions don't work and it has <a title="can't paste into gmail compose hyperlink dialog" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=355138">other</a> odd bugs.</p>
