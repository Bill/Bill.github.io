<p>When I made this <a href="http://jyte.com/cl/gmail-will-add-offline-mode-and-sync-in-2007">jyte claim</a> <a href="http://jyte.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/logo.gif?1180659691" /></a> a couple weeks ago (May 15, 2007) I believed it based solely on my personal experience of using web apps every day:<br />
<blockquote>A backlash is brewing against traditional thin-client web applications. Folks are tired of the beachball. Vendors of Web-based applications like Gmail, in which users spend a significant portion of their day, will respond by incorporating client-side persistence, offline operation and synchronization. In particular Gmail will add these features in 2007.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well then a couple days ago (May 30, 2007), Google announced <a href="http://gears.google.com">Google Gears <font size="-1"></font></a> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/workerpool.gif" />, their toolkit for offline web apps (connection detection, offline operation, offline storage) and updated Reader with an offline mode. This thing is similar in purpose to <a href="http://joyeur.com/2007/03/22/joyent-slingshot">Joyent's Slingshot</a> which went into Beta on the Mac on April 17, 2007.</p>
<p>It sure seems like the stage is set. Technology answers need. Only thing standing in the way might be competing priorities or strategic conflicts. Have to think about that a little bit.</p>
