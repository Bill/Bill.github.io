<p>I was the beneficiary of a new social norm at iPhone Tech Talk here in Seattle today. Unsurprisingly just about everybody's got an Apple laptop and power outlets are scarce. What's interesting is that since all our power connectors are compatible (MagSafe), folks are usually happy to just let you borrow their power supply for a while while you get a charge. Felt kinda uncomfortable at first. But that discomfort was brief. Now I'm boldly power surfing with impunity.</p>
