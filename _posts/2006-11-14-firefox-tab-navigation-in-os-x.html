<p>For those of you who like to keep your hands on the keyboard...</p>
<p>Control-tab will cycle to the next tab to the right (and wrap at the end).</p>
<p>Page-up and Page-down keys can be used to move to adjacent tabs in either direction (again, wrapping is in effect).  Control-page-up (control-fn-page-up on laptop keyboards) moves left.  Control-page-down (control-fn-page-down) moves right.</p>
