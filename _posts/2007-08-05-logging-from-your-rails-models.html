<p><strong>update 2010/10/16</strong>: <a href="https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/5141-deprecationproxy-for-rails_default_logger-hides-original-warn-method">RAILS_DEFAULT_LOGGER is deprecated</a>. I'm using ActiveRecord::Base.logger now as in:</p>
<pre style="padding-left:30px;">ActiveRecord::Base.logger.debug "value of x is #{x}"</pre>
<p>read on for the older solution…</p>
<p>I just spent five minutes figuring out how to log from a model class in Rails (or any class that isn't a controller or view). Y'see, there is no "logger" method on an ActiveRecord for instance.  Once again <a href="http://www.robbyonrails.com/articles/tag/logging">Robby to the rescue</a> with an oblique mention of the RAILS_DEFAULT_LOGGER global. I love that guy.</p>
<p>Related: I wonder what <a href="http://ruby.jamisbuck.org/rails-injected.html#s10">Jamis circa '05</a> was talking about when he said:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Note: logging is a bad example here, because Rails already has very good support for logging. Furthermore, recent Rails releases support a <em>service</em> keyword, for declaring and using system-global services in the same manner described here.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Huh? Service keyword?</p>
